[[Balance Verification Criteria]]


- Game mecanics rely on :

killing emeny (ghost or boss) quickly
cumulate gold 
level up or purchase item to maintain your kill speed

This balance can be controlled by 3 indicators:
Time To Kill Ghost // Time To Kill Boss
Ceil level
FTT
Triforce 
[[TTKG]]/[[TTKBoss]]
[[Ceil Level Difference // Sprint Level ]]
[[FTT]]
[[Remaining Available Gold After boost]]

Example:
[[TTKG]]: 20 sec 
[[TTKBoss]]: 5mn
[[Sprint Level]] : 5
[[Remaining Gold]] 20%

Benefit of support : TTKG -5mn
Benefit of active Pets : TTKG -5mn
Benefit of passive Pets : TTKG -5mn

spending ratios


- Boss mist be [[dangerous]]. 
BOss are dangerous enough if they force the player to refill health or spend money to purchase items.
A boss is dangerous,with [[hero worst possible surival time]] it's the time a hero can stay a live without refill his life when he is constantly hit by a boss.


- Items should be usefull 
They are usefull, if purchasing them has  a significant cost
They are usefull if using the, spare you money or make you go faster.
The items will be unlocked at a specific level, to help reduce the [[FTT]]


- Hero progression should be balanced. Provided you complete your [[FTT]] it should keep the value of the [[TTKG]] to his acceptable value.

- Diamonds usage should create a dilemma : increase your pet, or use a perks that will allow you to take down a boss with impossible [[TTKB]]


1 Supports must be balanced  :
  - support must be strong enough : reduce your [[TTKG]] [[TTKBoss]] [[FTT]]
  => finding the  [[BSL]]


2 It should not be too [[easy]] to level up the support 
   => [[gold]] to accumulate must leads to enough [[Support FTT]] to reach your [[BSL]]


3 It should not be annoying to farm => we should always have a quest to [[quickly]] complete 


4 We should unlock new hero at the correct time 


5 We should collect [[enough]] [[gold]] after a ghost drop
- Total Cumulated Gold at this level
- TTKG
- TTKB
- Ceil Level

[[enough]] [[gold]] means , that based on  [[spending ratio]], the gold input allocated to level up of support, hero, will bring you to proper [[TTKG]]


6 Pet must be balanced, strong enough to help significanlty : pet can reduce your [[TTKG]] [[TTKBoss]]   [[FTT]]


7 Pet must be balanced : the passive pet should reduce significantly your [[TTKG]] [[TTKBoss]]  [[FTT]]


8 Boss must be hard : [[TTKB]] should be big enough.

9 The game should be '[[hard enough]]'  , that means the time wihout level up should not be too long:
    [[Ceil Level]]  // [[Sprint Level]]
The more you play without levelup, the more your [[TTKG]] and [[TTKB]] will increase. The [[Ceil Level]] is the level for which, those time are considered too much.


Farming should not be [[annoying]]  we should have quest enough and regularly to reduce the [[FTT]]
