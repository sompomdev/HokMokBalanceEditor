FAct checks



Reminder about COVID - Omicron.

Dear all, i just want to make sure to get some facts straight to put back things in perspective.


Reminder : 
- Rumors are not truth
- Facebook is not truth
- Always Cross check media informations with several sources

I put all link reference to various studies/article at the end.


Fact 1 - Incubation period of Omicron is quicker than first variant.

Incubation Period: 2 to 3 days.  (see reference 1)
That means you will start developing symptoms quickly

For the people tested positive : the isolation period has been reduced to a maximum of 5 days depending on symptoms.

So even with close contact, if you dont have symptoms and you are negative, good chance is that there is no problem.


Fact 2 - Omicron is less dangerous than previous variant.  (see reference 2)
To summarize, the reason is the symptoms target mostly throat than respiratory system.

For reminder in Cambodia:
Around 3000 dead by COvid (all variants since the beginning of the Pandemic)

Death by traffic accident : 
More than 2000 people dies , by year, every year. 

And you cant vaccine yourself against car.


Fact 3 - Vaccines and booster help reduce the risk of serious symptoms

Most of you has 3 dose, with some 4th booster provides higher level of protection against omicron. Please note that the virus is mostly dangerous for older people that has vulnerabilites issues (obese, cardiac defect) (see reference 3) 


In summary: 
Regarding your ages and your vaccination status, you are exposed to very low risk of contracting serious symptoms. So the key point is to protect the transmission to older member of your family, which can be easily achieved by respecting the previous habits : hands cleaning, mask, distance from old.

And be carefull while you are driving.
