[[Balance Verification Criteria]]

# Formula quest gold


## KPI parameters

Quest ID
Quest Level
Ghost Level

## Return value
Gold amount

## Algorithm
If the criteria of validation is the time, depending on the type of the quest, we can associate a specific expecting winning time for a quest.
The quest completion will provide advantage in time, and this time will be converted in Gold based on the KPI (Gold Per Hour)//[[Gold per minute]]
of a higher level.

We wont make it dynamic, we will define a constant regarding the average [[TTKG]] of higher level. (it's important that a quest, is attached to a level)

A quest must provide more benefit than a farming of 10 minutes.

## Criteria Verification

Effect of the gold cumulated on the [[KPIS]]
A quest is interesting, if the gold quantity that the player can win with the quest, is more important than the gold he would have accumulate with a classic farming in a short period of time. (refer ot the KPI [[TTKG]])

Example:
I win 1000K , quest is not interesting if i need to farm less to reach this value.
