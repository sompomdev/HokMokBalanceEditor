Debrief BORA about QUests => balance.


Quest Selection :
 =>
 . quest not yet played from the same category




=> First IDEA:
convert anything in the game into 'Gold' 


Reference value:
HOw many gold you can win in 1mn ? with current DPS.


Example:
 
 
 
 
 - quest from a different category
 - 
- quest of the same type has been played before 
- if it's match the current 'progress' of the player. 


Algoroithm:

COST

LEVEL at which you can get cover the expense with N ghost killing.

Define the Evaluation from the level youa re on, based on how many income we want to balance
